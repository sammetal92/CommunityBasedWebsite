This is just a simple community based website me and my teammates made for our semester project for the Web Engineering course. Everything is made in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. The DBMS used is MySQL with PHPMyAdmin.

The database is named 'thegamebook', and the SQL file to import it to your own DBMS is in the root folder 'thegamebook.sql'.
